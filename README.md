This Program is to establish a robust intelligent system to aid our value investing efforts using stock market data. 
We make investment decisions and based on intrinsic value of companies and do not trade on the basis of daily market volatility. 
Our profit realization strategy typically involves weekly, monthly and quarterly performance of stocks we buy or hold.

Predicting stock price valuations on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Recommend BUY, HOLD, SELL decisions. Maximize capital returns, minimize losses. Ideally a loss should never happen. Minimize HOLD period.
Evaluating on the basis of capital returns using Bollinger Bands to measure the systems effectiveness.
